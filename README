libshdata

Lock free shared-memory library

The use-case handled by this library is that of one producer and several
consumers, that periodically exchange data that varies with time (e.g. the
acceleration on the 3 axis seen by an IMU sensor) ; therefore all the data
that is shared using this library has to be time-stamped.
Consumers can search for data produced right after/right before/close to a
given date, or for the latest data, and can retrieve that data and its
associated timestamps, one by one or in batch. It can also retrieve bits of that
data, called "quantities".
The producer, on its side, defines the data format and decides how far in data
history the consumers are allowed to go (which basically setups the length of
the ring-buffer used for communication).
All write & read operations are lock-free.
